    "Finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following my first assignment in RWET class, I wanted to continue with my sound checks. \n",
    "I needed to create a good soup with my main ingredient.\n",
    "what can be juxtapositioned/mixed with a sound check that feels natural?\n",
    "what my connection to the sound checks tells me about myself?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a sound check. a constant one.\n",
    "I love my body, but I am in a constant search for faults in my body, I invent symptoms and as a consequence, I ended up without results because such things don't really exist.\n",
    "I seek for diagnosis online, in the books or from my parents (both work in a hospital). the diagnosis is never enough to ease my thoughts.\n",
    "At times, I thought maybe a more psychological approach will help, things like; analysis, psychoanalysis, sitting in the psychologic office and talking for hours, online blog, web-MD, etc..all these failed to help me, my brain was faster, more efficient and it was only me that can shut it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of these thoughts is to come and go away without notice, they come in loops. because i am so aware of the process, they come with a lot of self-judgment.\n",
    "If I would need to explain how a loop looks like, it would be something like this:\n",
    "CHECK > REFLECTION ABOUT SELF > CHECK > SYMPTOMS > CHECK > DIAGNOSIS > CHECK > BEHAVIOR > SELF REFLECTION > CHECK\n",
    "I thought it a great start for a structure, which for me is the hardest part.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution:\n",
    "What I liked this time about my approach to the text is that I knew what are the tools I want to use.\n",
    "it was clear how each part should be treated in terms of the library in python.\n",
    "1 / The checks will be created randomly for a list of checks I had transcribed.\n",
    "2 / reflection about self - I wanted to turn the online advises into reflection about my self.\n",
    "the advice for people who suffer from anexity is usually: \"Stress makes sufferers feel more anxious\", \"don't make a change\", \"Doctor hopping isn't helpful\", \"You can swap knowledge and coping strategies\". I wanted these sentences to become a reflection about my self, using spacy I was able to first detect the nouns, ADP, adjectives, and verbs. and later form a new sentence with the start of \"I am ...\" and maybe lead to combinations like: \"i am a worried doctor\". i love the nature of these empty lines: \"stop worry\", \"control your thoughts\". since they are so not helpful i just wanted to become them.(if it make any sense... )\n",
    "3 / using JSON i imported 3 databases that I had: name of body parts, moods, and diagnosis.\n",
    "4 /I wanted to create combinations between body parts to moods and later attach to each a random diagnosis. at first, I tried to mess up with the diagnosis data set but it turned out to me not coherent and took the focus of the entire poem. I wanted to leave the diagnosis as true to life events because this is what I usually get with I go to see my doctor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obstacles:\n",
    "1 / Finding the right combination with spacy took me a long time, I wanted it to have this distorted feeling, not so coherent or perfect language, phrases like: \"I am similar with self\" made sense to me. \"I am unnecessary with increases\" also had the right sound for a stressed out person.\n",
    "2 / After having a couple of versions with the structure that I created I felt like the checks need to be more connected and integrated with all the ingredients, it should interfere the process of thought, it should disrupt the way I will read it. it will make it hard for me to read it because I know how a sound check sounds like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking my favorite version took me a long time, I had to run my code 60 times to understand better what I have created, all of them seemed to be ok and in the right spirit. mundane self-checks that end up to be nothing. after I will read one another one will come, just like in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment for me was also focused on how it is going to sound like, I wanted it to be something that I can perform with. that I can play with my voice. I know that by focusing on the content I might leave less room for code exploration. I tried to change it in this final assignment but it seems like I really need to understand my materials or have a personal connection in order to create. I don't feel strong enough with word vectors and it is something that I will work probably over the summer, continue the search with my vital checks projects.  but I like the fact that I can understand spacy and tracery to a point where I could think about the use of them while thinking about the concept.\n",
